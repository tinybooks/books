Introduction
------------

This isn’t a book about accumulating followers on Twitter, or amassing likes on Facebook. It’s a book about building deep relationships with your ‘1,000 True Fans’, and how nurturing these relationships can make the difference between success or failure.

If you’re starting a business now, you’re incredibly fortunate. The web extends your reach, allowing you to communicate with a truly global audience. Better still, the web and other tools powered by the internet are, for the most part, free. The web affords a new reality, it’s an incredibly powerful enabler, and – by embracing it – you can build a thriving and successful business.

Anyone can now become a channel (or, indeed, a series of channels) and in an increasingly connected age considering the ramifications of this can help transform you, and your business’s, potential for success.

The book draws on common sense advice I’ve been applying through my consultancy work assisting startups and on my MFA programme at the Belfast School of Art. When I’m working with fledgling creative startups there’s a tendency for them to want an instant payoff. That’s a mistake and expecting instant wins is a sure fire path to disappointment.

There is no path to instant riches, the advice I’m offering takes time and dedication, but it is tried and tested and has succeeded for the many startups I mentor.

This is a short, practical book, with accompanying worksheets. It’s intended to be read in one sitting and revisited periodically. With brevity in mind, let’s get started.


###A Note on the Worksheets

I believe in providing practical, hands-on advice and through my consultancy and teaching I’ve developed a series of worksheets that allow the underlying theory to be mapped onto reality.

At the end of the book (in the final chapter of ‘Required Reading’) I’ve provided a link to a downloadable series of printable worksheets. These are designed to be used in conjunction with the content of the book, allowing you to work through the ideas I’ll cover.

The worksheets are black and white and are designed to be kind to your toner cartridges. If you’ve completed worksheets and would like feedback, please do tweet with the hashtag #tinybooks, I’d love to see the results.

Chapter 1 - Reaching Your 1,000
-------------------------------

__This chapter explains what exactly I mean by your ‘1,000’ by introducing Kevin Kelly’s thoughts on ‘1,000 True Fans’. It encourages you to begin consciously building your fan base. Finally, it explains why understanding the phenomenon of FOAFOAFOAF… is critical to the success, or failure, of business in a connected world.__


> You need to alter what you do, and how you do it, so that 1,000 true fans is sufficient to make you very happy.
> —Seth Godin


Kevin Kelly, the founder of WIRED magazine, believes that any creative business can succeed with just [_1,000 True Fans_](http://j.mp/onethousandtruefans). __/* I think we might need a short detour here, to explain what the ‘long tail’ is. */__ Reflecting on Chris Anderson’s ideas (as outlined in Anderson’s excellent book [_The Long Tail_](#)), Kelly states:

> The long tail does not raise the sales of creators much, but it does add massive competition and endless downward pressure on prices.

No one likes, “massive competition and endless downward pressure on prices,” however, Kelly believes there is a sweet spot on the long tail. As he puts it:

> A creator, such as an artist, musician, photographer, craftsperson, performer, animator, designer, videomaker, or author – in other words, anyone producing works of art – needs to acquire only 1,000 True Fans to make a living.

Kelly defines a ‘true fan’ as one who will purchase anything and everything you produce, and he believes that 1,000 is the point at which one can balance nurturing the relationship with your fans and having a critical mass of fans that can sustain you. As he puts it, “One thousand is a feasible number. You could count to 1,000. If you added one fan a day, it would take only three years.”

Kelly assumes conservatively that a true fan will spend an average of $100 per year on what you do. Some, of course, will spend less, and some will spend more. On average that’s $100,000 a year. After some modest expenses that’s a not insubstantial salary. Even better if this salary is a by-product of doing what you love.

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

BOXOUT/DIAGRAM

So, how do the numbers stack up?

1,000 Fans × $100 = $100,000

Kelly wrote _1,000 True Fans_ in 2008, seven long years ago. Arguably those have been a turbulent few years, economically, but I think you’d agree that the principles remain even if inflation may have been curtailed across this period.

In short, find and nurture your 1,000 and you could be sitting on a $100,000 – £64,000 – turnover.

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

If you’ve ever run a successful business, you’re likely to find Kelly’s analysis compelling and, depending on your business, may have experienced the support of your 1,000 yourself. When I ran Fällt Publishing (http://www.fallt.com), an independent record label, around the turn of the millenium, the intense loyalty of my 1,000 made the difference between success and failure.

Look beyond individual purchases and consider your average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), or how much a customer spends with you over their lifetime, and you quickly begin to understand the importance of building deep relationships with your fans. Building these relationship takes time, but the reward can be the difference between winning and losing. It’s not about accumulating followers or amassing likes, it’s about building deep connections.

The web allows you to connect with your 1,000 in ways that before would have been prohibitively expensive. With the profusion of (often free) social media tools at your disposal you can now build a direct connection with your fans, sharing content that you, and – importantly – they, will find value in.

With this in mind, ask yourself: “What’s your message?” and “How might your message spread?” Your message needs to reflect your values and, by extension, it needs to reflect your personality. (If you haven’t put some thought into defining your values, I’d recommend you [drop everything, and do so now](#).)

Finally, identify the channels that your 1,000 inhabit. There are a wealth of channels online… This needs to stress that – first and foremost – the web is a channel and you should give some thought to your web site (what content are you sharing there?). This should form the central core, around which you layer your other communication.

Email is also – surprisingly in an age of email overload – an incredibly effective channel to connect with your 1,000. Companies like [MailChimp](#) and [Campaign Monitor](#) enable you to easily set up a periodical newsletter to keep your 1,000 in the loop.

Lastly, you have a wealth of social channels at your disposal: Twitter and Facebook; Pinterest and Instagram; and many, many more. It pays to undertake some research at this point. Ask yourself, “Where is the best place to meet my 1,000?” Every business is different, research yours and plan accordingly.


###Building a Fan Base

Growing your fan base using the web and social media isn’t about gaming the system and accumulating followers like there’s no tomorrow, it’s about building deep relationships with your 1,000. As Kelly puts it, “Win over one new fan a day and you’ll have reached your 1,000 within three years.” In short, you need to be in it for the long haul.

Put some thought into it your message and the rewards will pay off in time. Like anything worth doing, it’s hard work, but the return on your investment will come. You just need to be patient.

I passionately believe in Kelly’s thesis. Yes, there are many brands (large and small) with followers that number in the tens and hundreds of thousands, there are many that count followings in the millions, but for the fledgling business starting out, focusing on your 1,000, first and foremost, is critical. Build that fan base and, above all, look after them. They will become your evangelists.

At this point you might be wondering: Why would anyone follow me? The answer, I believe, is that the world is crying out for individuals with a clearly defined message – a passion and a purpose – who aren’t afraid to share that message.

It can be difficult to step into the spotlight and share your passion, but – trust me – if you stick to your principles you’ll succeed. As Seth Godin puts it in his book _Tribes_:

> Great leaders don’t try to please everyone. Great leaders don’t water down their message in order to make the tribe a bit bigger. Instead, they realize that a motivated, connected tribe in the midst of a movement is far more powerful than a larger group could ever be.

As Godin underlines, it’s not about the numbers, it’s about the message. There are so many cardboard cutout businesses in the world, businesses that lack personality; the world needs more personality, put some thought into yours. As Jules Winnfield puts it in _Pulp Fiction_: “Personality goes a long way.”

It’s critical to spend some time teasing out the values that matter to you and, with these as a foundation, consider how you communicate in a tone of voice that reflects those values. This is important and isn’t something to rush.

When establishing the tone of voice of The Standardistas (www.webstandardistas.com) – a tweed-clad speaking duo I spent a pleasurable few years touring the globe in – we spent a great deal of time on identifying and clarifying our tone of voice, ensuring it echoed who we were, both as individuals and as a duo.

The Standardistas’s biography on Twitter was written to give our 1,000 a sense of our identity:

> Two tweed-clad gentlemen based in Belfast, we write about design, web standards and assorted miscellany in a daily periodical you might enjoy reading.

There are a lot of triggers in those two dozen words, and the specific choice of words we used was important: tweed-clad, gentlemen, assorted miscellany, a daily periodical…. Words carefully crafted to reflect the personality of two individuals who had first united over a shared fondness for facial hair. Old-fashioned, casting a backwards glance to a distant cultured time, the personality echoed offline reality. (We always wore tweed, indeed, I still do.)

__/* I’m wondering if this might be better *not* using my experiences? How will this roll out across multiple books, as a series, all written by me. Perhaps it would be better to use others and highlight examples of best practice? This also builds relationships with those featured in the books. */__

When building a fan base – in particular, focusing on your 1,000 – define your message. You need to know the story inside out. If it’s truly your story, you’ll have no problem. Authenticity matters, never forget that.


###FOAFOAFOAF…

At this point you might be wondering, what exactly does this abbreviation ‘FOAFOAFOAF…’ mean? It’s simple: FOAFOAFOAF… is shorthand for ‘friend of a friend of a friend of a friend…’, a phenomenon that’s supercharged by the ever-connected world we live in.

In _Permission Marketing_, Seth Godin explores the idea of, “Turning strangers into friends and friends into customers.” At first glance this idea might appear a little brutal (“It’s all about the customer!”), but I believe that would be to miss the point. Increasingly customers are crying out for products underpinned by purpose and backed by provenance.

Today’s customer has a wealth of tools at their disposal to dig a little deeper beneath the surface picture that many brands like to portray. Consumers, and their disposable income, are seeking deeper connections with the brands they support.

Social media allows you to connect with others easily. It allows you to turn strangers into friends and, if you put some work into what you’re curating, connect with their friends (and their friends, and so on…). I like to call this powerful phenomenon FOAFOAFOAF….

I need to talk about communicating here… 1. Brands that communicate well (Tescos are great, as are Slack); 2. Brands that ignore you (I won’t mention names, I’m sure you know some…). Conversation is, by its nature, two way. If one of your 1,000 asks you a question, reply.

Simple.

No one likes to be ignored. A timely response, something short (no need for _War and Peace_) is all it takes to leave someone with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Ignore your customers at you peril. For one thing, it’s rude, but of more concern, it can lead very quickly to ill will.

Everyone starts small. Never forget that. Should your star rise and – great news – your audience grow, never forget your humble beginnings. No one likes an aloof ‘celebrity’ that’s lost touch with their origin.

Treat people with courtesy and respect, mind your Ps and Qs, and reply politely when someone has a query. Do that and the rest will fall into place. (You’d be surprised how few people say ‘thank you’ any more; embrace this habit and you’ll stand out from the crowd.)

Chapter 2 - Pillars of Content
------------------------------

__This chapter emphasises the importance of defining a clear content strategy and putting some thought into your ‘Pillars of Content’. It stresses the importance of defining your core themes so that your message doesn’t drift. Finally, it outlines a number of strategies for building a ‘Discovery Engine’, a set of tools you can use to ensure the content you’re sharing is interesting and relevant to your 1,000.__


> Someone’s quote on something to do with content…
> —Not Godin


Spend some time identifying your ‘Pillars of Content’. Ask yourself: What are your fans interested in? What do they value?

Too few put the time and effort in here, preferring to think that social media is a catch-all panacea and a path to celebrity, ‘throwing spaghetti at a wall’ and hoping some of it sticks. The opposite is the case. Growing a following is hard work. Invest in your audience, put the time in; only if you do so, will you reap the rewards.

With this in mind, ask yourself: “What are your core themes?” and “How will you discover this content?”

Again this involves returning to your core values and revisiting your mission. Ask yourself, “What’s my goal?” “What are my 1,000 interested in?” “What are the overlaps between my interests and my 1,000’s interests?”

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

Find the overlap, it’s the sweet spot. Of course, you need to find room for spontaneity, but define your core message and from here extrapolate out to identify your ‘Pillars of Content’.

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

It’s important to stress that you need to stay on topic. If your audience is interested in design, entrepreneurship and startup culture, then focus around those topics and don’t drift. Yes, you might have a passion for fixed-gear bicycles, but does your audience? Of course, your personality is important and that personality should shine through, but try to keep on message. Endless tweets about the intricacies of derailleurs might not be what your 1,000 need to hear.


###What are your core themes?

What are your audience interested in? Why are they following you? More importantly, what are you interested in? What are you trying to achieve? Address these questions and your core themes will emerge.

Reward your 1,000’s loyalty to your brand with hard work and pay back their investment in you by setting aside time to create great content. A great way to do this is to harness the power of the crowd, get a few stakeholders together in a room and workshop everything out.

Mind mapping is a great tool for getting content down. Do this first, then – when you’ve mapped out a number of content types – undertake a spot of organisation. Ask yourself: What overarching themes emerge? Find the commonalities, these will form the core of your pillars of content.

Working with the team at Turf (www.theturf.io), a startup based in Belfast, we spent fifteen minutes focused on volume, using word association and working fast to generate a large number of associated topics and themes. Turf’s describe their product as:

> A marketplace to discover the best design and lifestyle products curated from the finest makers in the world.

Using this as a launching point we built a word map, intended to pin down some of the company’s key motivators.

__/* IMPORTANT QUESTION: I’m wondering if some of this is actually worksheet stuff. It’s perhaps breaking up the flow too much, and could be handled – as bundled examples – with the worksheets? For example, I provide blank Mind Map and Themes’ worksheets and accompany these with examples, e.g. Turf. */__

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

100s of words for Turf, presented as a mind map.

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

With this in hand, we took our braindump and imposed a little order on it, searching for key themes.

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

BOXOUT/DIAGRAM

We worked from our initial mind map, searching for patterns within the content types we’d identified that represented Turf’s ‘Pillars of Content’.

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

This is about considering your audience’s interests – after all, they’re following you for a reason – it’s also about gently aligning your interests and theirs. All too often this work is left to chance (i.e. it isn’t done, usually because, “There isn’t time.”). There is no point spending time on building a channel for your brand if you’re going to throw spaghetti at a wall and hope some sticks.

Spend some time on this. What you communicate shapes others’ perceptions of you and I’m sure you’d like that perception to be favourable. In short, bypass this work at your peril.

__/* One final aspect to mention – which I think is important – is identifying key stakeholders around the themes. Taking Turf as an example, we’ve identified a list of key influencers around the brand: Dan Rubin, Elliot Jay Stocks, Jessica Hische, Swiss Miss, Kai Brach…. This should probably be mention (possibly also with interviews?). */__


###Build a Discovery Engine

With your ‘Pillars of Content’ established, put some time into building a ‘Discovery Engine’, a tool, or series of tools, you can use to prime your brain with great content that you can share and that your fans will find useful.

There are a wealth of tools that can help drive discovery. Every business is different and every business with have different channels, but there are some cores strategies you can follow to ensure your content engine is forever fuelled and ready to go.

I like to think of a 'Discovery Engine' as a parallel to the culinary term ‘mise en place’,  which translates as ‘putting in place’. Mise en place is used in professional kitchens to refer to organising and arranging the ingredients that a cook will require for the menu items that are expected to be prepared during a shift. 

Think of your 'Discovery Engine' as a series of tools you can use at the service of content discovery. These might include tools as simple as your Safari or Chrome dashboard (Safari's is called 'Top Sites'); an RSS reader; or a series of Twitter Lists you've built to echo your core themes' content.

Using your browser's Top Sites equivalent, gather and curate a series of useful sites that offer daily inspiration. There are numerous aggregators, for example, [Alltop](http://alltop.com), which collects 'all the top stories' from Fast Company, WIRED and the New York Times and numerous others. This, and other sites like it, are incredibly useful for content discovery.

__/* I'll be supplying a Top Sites generic browser worksheet that readers can use to map out their specific sites for inspiration. */__

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

Most browsers offer a dashboard', a . These are incredibly useful, giving you a launch point to start the day.

RSS might be old school, but it works. /* Explain what RSS is. */ Also round up some content aggregators. 


----


Chapter 3 - It’s All About Programming
--------------------------------------

Turn on the television, switch channels and you expect to be greeted by content that reflects that channel’s purpose and values. Communicating your message via the web and social media is no different.

Your 1,000 expect your channel to be maintained and they expect it to be consistently programmed. If you switch to a channel and find it’s not broadcasting, you immediately wonder, “Is this channel still active?” The worst thing you can do is fluctuate between content that’s ‘all on’ and ‘all off’. It’s far better to schedule your content so that it’s consistently delivered.

With this in mind, ask yourself: “What’s your programming schedule?” and “How might you find ways to ease the burden of programming your schedule?”


###Weekly Pattern

Put some thought into a ‘Weekly Pattern’, a schedule – just like any broadcaster would use – that delivers a mix of interesting content in a timely manner.

The idea is to reduce the time you spend thinking, “Hmmm… what will I tweet?” (This rationale can, of course, be applied to other social tools.)

I call this a ‘Weekly Pattern’ and it’s designed to ensure your social activity is a little more streamlined. Often the first thing that gets dropped at a busy startup (where everyone’s always firefighting) is social content. Mapping it out in this way allows you to save tweets as you find them, to Buffer, then – on a Sunday – spend an hour organising and queuing up the week’s content.

Putting some thought into a weekly pattern (with room for spontaneous sharing of time-sensitive discoveries and @replies to customers) helps you to build out a week’s worth of content without too much cognitive burden. Twitter can absorb copious quantities time through simply wondering, “What can I post?” Save all of that work by planning out your strategy and thinking it all through in advance.

All too often folks’ Twitter (etc.) strategy amounts to nothing more than throwing spaghetti at the wall, let’s plan a little more carefully than that and create something of value for followers. I’d suggest you use the ‘Weekly Pattern’ in conjunction with the ‘Pillars of Content’ to give you a more focused strategy for Twitter.

Talk about how different types of content generate different levels of engagement. Images, based on my research (and for a visual topic, like design), generate more engagement. I’m currently testing different weightings, increasing the use of imagery.

Different content types:

+ Discoveries are essentially links to interesting content, I gather these throughout the day, queuing to Buffer when I find something interesting that I think my followers would enjoy. If you write a tweet as you discover it and save it to Buffer, it reduces a lot of work on the Sunday.

+ Images are image posts, where I craft 600 x 300 pixel image edits, these were the ‘jewels’ I showed you. I spend a lot of time on these edits as they echo a distinct visual aesthetic I’ve developed over the years.

+ Quotations are just that, quotations. Again, I gather these as I go and then organise them on Sunday. Don’t underestimate the quotations, my followers always engage with them, and they’re low hanging fruit, an easy win.

+ Finally, there are a handful of hashtagged posts (#bestofted, etc.). These tend to be links to timeless content and can be developed in bulk, when I have time, and then queued as necessary.

These kind of patterns reduce the time spent thinking (What next?”) and free you up to focus on what’s a much more important task, finding interesting content for your 1,000.


###Reduce Cognitive Burden

Delivering consistent content is hard, it’s important to find ways to reduce the mental load. Programming a channel isn’t easy, whether it’s a traditional channel, like television or radio, or an emerging channel, like Twitter or Facebook. By using a few tried and tested techniques you can reduce the cognitive burden of maintaining your social media presence.

Fill in the gaps…

BOXOUT

By establishing a pattern for some of your content you can free up a little time for spontaneity elsewhere. Using text fragments, that you populate with content later, allows you to repurpose dead time or, when you find something on your travels, format it quickly.

In its raw state a text fragment might be something like this, establishing a hashtag and a pattern:

	#weekendreads, ‘Title’: URL
 
This might be populated as follows (astute readers will notice some of this book’s references):

	#weekendreads, ‘1,000 True Fans’: http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/

	#weekendreads, ‘The Austerity Delusion’: http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion

	#weekendreads, ‘Why the Fax Machine Isn’t Quite Dead Yet’: http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150224-why-the-fax-machine-wont-die

This pattern streamlines content – of a longer format nature – that I share with followers for weekend reading.

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

Use dead time. Tools like Simplenote can transform the most mundane of settings – a supermarket queue or a bus journey –

Chapter 4 - Case Study: Pinboard
--------------------------------

https://pinboard.in/about/

If you haven’t heard of [Pinboard](#), I’d recommend exploring what it has to offer. As its creator Maciej Cegłowski puts it Pinboard is, “A bookmarking website for introverted people in a hurry.”

It’s a lovely little service with thousands of loyal users. <!-- How many? --> Unlike the majority of web-based tools, it’s a paid service, designed to reassure subscribers that it has longevity. Talk about Delicious (a free, prescursor that sadly disappeared after Yahoo! acquired it) and Cegłowski’s pricing rationale:
