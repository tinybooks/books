Tiny Books
==========

_Tiny Books_ are short books for creative entrepreneurs, about the design of business and the business of design.

In the spirit of the advice I'm sharing via (ship early, ship often) I'm working on the various Tiny Books in the open. As and when books are finished, they will be available via [Gumroad](http://gumroad.com/tinybooks).
